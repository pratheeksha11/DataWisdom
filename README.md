# Data Wisdom: My Learning Journey of Data & Technology

Welcome to "Data Wisdom," where I document my learning journey through the fascinating world of technology with a focus on machine learning and data science. This repository will serve as a platform to share knowledge, explore new trends, and reflect on the ever-evolving landscape of AI and data analytics.

## Post 1: High-Level Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project Outline
Creating a high-level Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project is an essential skill for any data scientist. It allows us to understand the data's underlying patterns and to formulate hypotheses for further investigation. This post has the steps I'll be following for an EDA project suitable for inclusion in a GitHub portfolio.
Check out the [EDA Project Outline](https://github.com/pratheeksha11/DataWisdom/blob/main/EDA_Project_Outline.md) for a detailed walkthrough.
