# Exploratory Data Analysis Project Outline

Welcome to the first entry of my tech learning journey! This post outlines the steps for creating a high-level Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project suitable for showcasing in a GitHub portfolio.

## Steps Overview

1. **Data Overview**
   - Perform a quick inspection of the data to understand its structure.
   - Identify the types of variables present.
   - Check for any obvious inconsistencies or missing data.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values and duplicates.
   - Correct or remove any erroneous entries.

3. **Descriptive Statistics**
   - Summarize the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the dataset's distribution.

4. **Data Visualization**
   - Create histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and more to visually explore the data.

5. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Determine the relationships between variables using correlation coefficients and pair plots.

6. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create new features that could be beneficial for modeling or further analysis based on the findings.

7. **Hypothesis Testing**
   - Conduct statistical tests to verify any proposed hypotheses.

8. **Predictive Modeling (if applicable)**
   - Build a simple model to predict a target variable (if present) and evaluate its performance.

9. **Insights & Conclusion**
   - Summarize the key findings and insights drawn from the EDA.

10. **Documentation**
    - Ensure all steps of the analysis are well-documented and commented for clarity and future reference.

11. **Presentation**
    - Present the EDA findings in a clear, presentation-friendly format, like a Jupyter notebook with Markdown explanations.
